            <p class="p2"><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
            <p class="p2">The FaceSapce.AI website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A
                cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to
                run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be
                read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p2">One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
                The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
                example, if you personalize FaceSapce.AI pages, or register with FaceSapce.AI site or services, a cookie
                helps FaceSapce.AI to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process
                of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When
                you return to the same FaceSapce.AI website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved,
                so you can easily use the FaceSapce.AI features that you customized.</p>

            <p class="p2">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
                cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose
                to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the FaceSapce.AI
                services or websites you visit.</p>
